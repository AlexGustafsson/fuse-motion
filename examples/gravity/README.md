## Motion demo: Gravity
This demo uses the gravity and attitude readings of the device to display a dropshadow which is affected by the device's motion.

Pivoting the device left to right controls the position of the "sun" and therefore the `Angle` of the dropshadow.

Tilting the device (from its back facing the ground to it being tilted 90 degrees facing the user) controls the `Distance` of the dropshadow.
